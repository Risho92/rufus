# Rufus: Building an Intelligent Web Data Extraction Tool for RAG Systems

## Architecture Overview
Rufus would be designed with these core components:

- Instruction Interpreter: An LLM-powered module that translates user instructions into crawling strategies
- Intelligent Crawler: A flexible web crawler that navigates sites based on relevance heuristics
- Content Extractor: Identifies and extracts meaningful content from HTML
- Document Synthesizer: Structures extracted data into RAG-ready formats
- API Layer: Provides simple developer interface and authentication

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Key Features Explained

- Keywords to prioritize
- Content types to focus on
- Relevance criteria
- Termination conditions

#### 2. Intelligent Content Extraction
Rufus goes beyond simple HTML scraping with:

Main Content Detection: The _extract_main_content method identifies and extracts the meaningful parts of a page while filtering out navigation, headers, footers, and other boilerplate.
Relevance Scoring: Each page is evaluated based on keyword matches and LLM-based relevance assessment to ensure only valuable content is processed.

#### 3. Smart Link Prioritization
Unlike basic crawlers that follow every link, Rufus uses:

- Domain filtering to stay on-site
- Content-type detection to prioritize valuable page types (FAQs, product info)
- Link text analysis to follow the most promising paths
- Depth control to manage crawl scope

#### 4. Document Synthesis
The most powerful feature is how Rufus transforms raw web content into structured documents:

Content is grouped by type (FAQ, product info, etc.)
Similar content is aggregated
An LLM synthesizes the information into coherent, well-structured documents
Metadata preserves source links for attribution

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Dynamic Content:

Challenge: Many sites use JavaScript to load content
Solution: Implement optional headless browser integration for JavaScript rendering. This was attempted using selenium package but could not be completed within the allocated time.

### Cost

Challenge: Cost to handle a single prompt could be above $5
Solution: This solution is using the latest models from OpenAI. These has to be swapped with smaller models before productionalizing.

#### Rate Limiting:

Challenge: Aggressive crawling can trigger site defenses
Solution: Concurrent request management with configurable limits and polite delays

#### Content Relevance:

Challenge: Determining what content matters to the user
Solution: Two-tier relevance scoring (keyword + LLM evaluation)

#### Site Structure Variability:

Challenge: Every site organizes content differently
Solution: Flexible content extraction that adapts to different page layouts

#### Dynamic Child Link Construction

Challenge: Links to sub pages are dynamically constructed using Javascript
Solution: requests_html module is used to extract the sub page links

API Design Considerations
The API is designed for simplicity while allowing advanced configuration:

## Simple usage
documents = client.scrape("https://example.com", "Find product information")

## Advanced usage
client = RufusClient(
    api_key=key,
    max_pages=50,
    concurrency=10,
    max_depth=3,
    min_relevance=0.3,
    output_format='json',
    output_file='custom_file_name'
)
documents = client.scrape(
    "https://example.com",
    "Find product information and pricing details"
)
client.save_documents(documents)

## Usage Example
The examples/basic_usage.py shows how easily Rufus can be used.

## RufusClient Parameters

- api_key: OpenAI key
- max_pages: Maximum number of pages Rufus should crawl
- concurrency: Maximum concurrency when crawling. This limit the number of threads spawn during webscraping.
- max_depth: Maximum depth to which crawling should happen. Eg: depth 3 means a url, sub url and sub sub url will be crawled.
- min_relevance: Content in the webpage should cross this relevance threshold to be considered as relevant content. Value is between 0-1. A lower number means a lot more content will be considered relevant.
- output_format: json and text are the available output formats
- output_file: Name of the output file. A unique identifier will be appended to this file name.

## Scalability and Maintainability
To ensure Rufus remains reliable and scalable:

- Concurrency Control: ThreadPoolExecutor manages parallel requests
- Error Handling: Robust exception handling for network issues
- Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Configuration: Adjustable parameters for different site types
- Output Flexibility: Multiple output formats (JSON, text) for different use cases

## Integration with RAG

Output of Rufus can be written out to json or text file. Text from this file can be used as the input for RAG. json may be the best format to use. Given below is the structure of json file

- type: one of the types
- title: Title of the webpage
- content: Contents from the url relevant to user's prompt
- metadata:
    - source_urls: all the urls Rufus crawled
    - creation_time: creation time of the file
    - instruction_prompt: user's prompt

## Conclusion
Rufus addresses the key challenges in web data extraction for RAG systems by combining traditional web crawling with LLM-powered intelligence. The design focuses on:

- Making complex web extraction accessible through simple instructions
- Creating high-quality, structured documents ready for RAG systems
- Building a flexible system that can adapt to various websites
- Ensuring maintainability through clean architecture and error handling

This implementation allows engineers to seamlessly extract web content with minimal configuration while producing reliable, structured data for their RAG applications.
